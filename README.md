# Ansible issues
This is a *"main"* project to track my use-cases for Ansible issues.

This repository takes advantage of [*Bash Magic Enviro*](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/bash-magic-enviro/blob/main/README.md) (*BME*) so, if you already configured your Bash console to use it, your environment will be automatically configured once you enter your sandbox' root directory.

Once *BME* is properly configured, multigit will populate a *issues/* hierarchy, with an issue per directory.
Each directory under *issues/* showcases one issue.

## Issues
* **[ansible-41313](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/ansible-issue-41313):** meta: flush_handlers doesn't honor when clause.  [See ticket](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41313).
* **[ansible-69677](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/ansible-issue-69677):** Per var merging of lists (and hashes?).  [See ticket](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69677).
