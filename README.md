# Ansible issues
This is a *"main"* project to track my use-cases for Ansible issues.

This repository takes advantage of [*Bash Magic Enviro*](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/bash-magic-enviro/blob/main/README.md) so, if you already configured your Bash console to use it, your environment will be automatically configured once you enter your sandbox' root directory.
